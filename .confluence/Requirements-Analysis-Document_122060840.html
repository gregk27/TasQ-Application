<h1 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Broad-ViewSummary"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;font-size: 24.0px;">Broad-View Summary</span></h1><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Background"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;font-size: 24.0px;">Background</span></h2><p>In any area of work, tasks seem to increase exponentially with time. It can get very hard to keep track of all the new additional tasks when already having a full plate. It can be very easy to lose track of all responsibilities and fall into a pit of disorganization. To-Do Lists and management systems prevent these disasters and provide an outline of all responsibilities, roles, and tasks. All in all, making tasks more manageable, organized and allows users to be mentally focused.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-PurposeoftheSystem">Purpose of the System</h2><p>Although several to-do list applications exist, none of them are catered towards students. The team plans to create an application that will allow students to integrate their school schedule with other activities and keep them organized.</p><p>In the application, users will be able to sync in their class schedule and manually add in any additional information. Moreover, the software will have features such as a reminder system, to-do lists, schedule management, sorting and filtering, profile feature, and search function.</p><p>The schedule feature will allow the user to view their weekly details in a list or a calendar view. Additionally, they would have access to adding and deleting events from their schedule. Users can add their assignments, quizzes, and exams to their schedule with the following attributes – name, class, weightage, and due date. Moreover, they can filter and sort their events by those attributes. All events in the calendar will have a reminder function, which will allow the user to select when they want to be reminded about the event. Furthermore, the user can always search for any event using the search function in the application.</p><p>Users can create to-do lists. These lists will be separate from events in the calendar and are intended for users to note down any short-term tasks. Every user will have a profile section, where they would be able to add their names, age, school, and profile image.</p><p>The application will utilize a tab design to allow users to navigate between the features of the application like a class schedule, assignments pages, and to-do lists.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-ScopeoftheSystem">Scope of the System</h2><p>This application is positioned as a tool for students to track their course responsibilities, including lectures, labs, tests, and assignments. It is designed to serve the student and their use cases as best as possible. This is not a general-purpose calendar nor is it a project management tool.</p><p>To accomplish this, the applications enables students to track course deliverables and their progress. It offers a tool to schedule lectures and deliverables, and a to-do list to track daily progress towards these goals. Students can also set reminders on deliverables and lectures that will be delivered within the app and on the local machine.</p><p>As a convenience, students can opt to publish and subscribe to courses. When a course is published, other students can subscribe to it, importing all of its lectures and deliverables. </p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-ObjectivesoftheSystemandSuccessCriteria">Objectives of the System and Success Criteria</h2><p>The objectives of this application are:</p><ol><li>Enable students to manage their courses</li><li>Enable students to track progress toward deliverables</li><li>Remind students of upcoming lectures and deliverables</li><li>Enable students to crowdsource data</li></ol><p>The success of the system is measured by:</p><ol><li>Convenience of viewing lectures &amp; deliverables in calendar view</li><li>Convenience of viewing lectures &amp; deliverables in calendar view</li><li>Simplicity of managing (CRUD) course lectures &amp; deliverables</li><li>Usefulness of reminders</li><li>Usefulness of to-do list</li><li>Orchestration of course publishers and subscribers</li></ol><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Users">Users</h2><p>Those who will primarily benefit from the application and be affected by it include:</p><ol><li>Queen’s University students.</li><li>University and college students.</li><li>High school students.</li><li>General population.</li></ol><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-AssumptionsandConstraints">Assumptions and Constraints</h2><ol><li>The majority of the project's code must be in C++.</li><li>The team has 6 weeks to complete the project.</li><li>The team has no budget, but has access to the development tools necessary.</li><li>The team has varying degrees of knowledge regarding C++ coding.</li></ol><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-FunctionalRequirements"><span style="font-size: 24.0px;letter-spacing: -0.01em;">Functional Requirements</span></h2><p>This section discusses all features the team wishes to implement into the application. Each functional requirement is described in-depth with an overview of the function, reasons for choosing the function, and a user story. </p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-CalendarView&amp;Reminders">Calendar View &amp; Reminders</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to view and be reminded of all of my events including class schedule, upcoming deadlines.</li><li>As a student, I want to know about my upcoming events, classes, assignments.</li><li>As a student, I want to have all of my upcoming events related to classes, assignments, and clubs in one centralized location.</li></ul><p>The calendar feature will display users' schedules including classes, upcoming deadlines, and any other scheduled event such as club meetings. Users will be able to view the calendar in the formats of a daily schedule, weekly schedule, monthly schedule, and a list view. Users will also be able to configure their calendars to display Sunday at the end or beginning of the week. All events will be entered into the calendar database and users will have the option to turn &quot;reminders&quot; on or off for each event. The Reminder feature will allow students to configure a date and time reminder for each event in the calendar. Reminders will show as either a banner-style notification in the app or a notification icon at the top corner of their screen where they will have to click on. As students have many different aspects of life to balance, whether it be classes, assignments, clubs, or study time, the calendar and reminder system will allow users to stay organized, track due dates, plan ahead, and have all of their upcoming events centralized in one location.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Assignments/Events">Assignments/Events</h2><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">As a student, I want to know when my tests are so I can be prepared.</span></li><li>As a student, I want to easily track my upcoming assignments so I can stay ahead.</li><li>As a student, I want to see how my work is weighted so I know what to prioritize.</li></ul><p>The main elements that will be saved by the application are assignments and events.  Events represent the broad range of calendar entries, with a time, duration, and location. Events will be used for class schedule components such as lectures, tutorials, and labs, in addition to meetings and tests/quizzes. Assignments are instantaneous events, representing a deliverable with a set due date and time. Assignments and events can also be assigned course weight, allowing for easily prioritizing based on value. These will be displayed on the monthly calendar and the weekly schedule, as well as the list view. Assignments and events are central to the application as the objective is to unify schedule information.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Filtering&amp;Sorting">Filtering &amp; Sorting</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to see what is most pressing so I can prioritize it.</li><li>As a student, I want to know which assignments are left in a course so I can know what to expect.</li><li>As a student, I want to see what my next big assignment will be so I can be prepared.</li></ul><p>The filtering and sorting tools allow for easily finding and prioritizing upcoming assignments and events. Users will be able to filter their assignments and events by a variety of parameters, such as course, type (lecture, lab, tutorial, test/quiz), and location. The filtered results can then be sorted by parameters such as date and time, duration, and grade weight. Giving students the ability to filter and sort their activities and events makes it easier to see what is urgent and important so time can be better planned.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-To-DoList">To-Do List</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to be able to jot down tasks that are not intended for the calendar view.</li><li>As a student, I want to be able to quickly write down small tasks on the go.</li><li>As a student, I want to have a running list of tasks I need to do throughout the day.</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 0.0cm;"><span style="color: black;">The To-Do List feature will provide users the ability to create simple jot notes of short-term tasks on a blank canvas. Any task or reminder that is written down in the To-Do List will not be visible anywhere else on the app such as the calendar view. The To-Do List is a stand-alone feature that is intended to act as a sticky note with easy and quick access, that does not clutter the already filled calendar. The To-Do List feature is beneficial as it centralizes tasks that need the user's immediate attention. To-Do Lists help users stay organized and provide them with a clear outline of the tasks at hand. When a task is completed it can be crossed off or deleted which provides users with a sense of achievement and accomplishment, giving them the incentive to keep using this feature. The reasons for including the To-Do List feature are that they improve memory, and increase productivity and motivation. As students with extremely busy lives, To-Do Lists are a vital feature to keep everyone organized and on top of their work. </span></p><p style="margin-left: 0.0cm;"><br/></p><p style="margin-left: 0.0cm;"><br/></p><p style="margin-left: 0.0cm;"><br/></p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Profiles/Crowdsource">Profiles/Crowdsource</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to make sure my schedule is stored securely so I don't have to worry about losing it.</li><li>As a student, I want to spend the minimum amount of time configuring my schedule so I can better use that time.</li><li>As a student, I want confidence that assignment dates are correct so I don't have to worry about missing something.</li></ul><p>The application will have network functionality through user profiles and crowdsourced data. By allowing users to create profiles, their courses, assignments, and events can be synchronized across computers or easily recovered if their computer is lost. With crowdsourced course data, users can upload data for a particular course (weekly schedule, assignments, and events) and others can simply subscribe to add it to their profile. If the course is modified, subscribed users will receive the updates to ensure their schedules are up to date. By attaching profile names to the public data, users can see who is providing the data to verify its quality. Allowing students to get their schedules directly will significantly help in planning, as it removes the data entry time and prevents worrying about whether they remembered to enter an assignment.</p><h1 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Non-FunctionalRequirements">Non-Functional Requirements</h1><p><span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);">Non-functional requirements refer to the characteristics that a software product must have in order to meet user requirements other than functional requirements. </span>Each non-functional requirement is listed with a brief overview and a user story.</p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Processingtimerestrictions">Processing time restrictions</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to use an application with a quick response, so that I can do things efficiently.</li><li>As a student, I want to see my course-related assignments and events immediately once I click on a course so that I can save time on looking for them on the course syllabus. </li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(55,55,55);">Processing time is the amount of time a system </span>takes to process a given request<a href="#RequirementsAnalysisDocument-REF1">[1]</a>. People are not willing to use a software if they cannot get feedback from an application immediately. Therefore, an algorithm with high efficiency is necessary to make the processing time short when designing each function. <span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Algorithm efficiency refers to the execution time of the algorithm. And t</span><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">he execution time is measured by the time consumed when compiling the program.</span></p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-OS">OS </h2><ul><li>As a user, I want the software to be compatible with many different Operating Systems so that I can have easy access to the tool.</li><li>As a student, I want the tool to be available on Mac so that I do not have to find a Windows laptop to run it, vice versa.</li></ul><p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">In a computer, the operating system is the most basic and important as it </span><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">manages computer hardware and software resources.

Meanwhile, people are less likely to use low-level security software, so it is obligatory for the developers to ensure user privacy. The private data should only be accessible to the users themselves. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20.0px;letter-spacing: -0.008em;">Memory usage</span></p><ul><li>As a user, I want to keep the memory usage of a program at a low level, so that I can run other programs at the same time.</li><li>As a student, I do not want my laptop memory usage to go beyond 80% so that I can use my laptop smoothly.</li></ul><p><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Programs that occupy a large amount of memory sometimes take up a lot of CPU resources, which will affect the operation of other programs.

For example, when<span style="color: rgb(32,33,36);"> using 2G memory, Win7 can basically reach more than 50% when booting up, and running a point program will inevitably reach 80%. If it consumes more than 50% memory usage when running the tool, the laptop may freeze. </span></span></p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Maintenance">Maintenance</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want to see regular updates of the organization tool, so that I can know the latest information.</li><li>As a student, I want to have accurate course-related information, so that I will not miss exams or assignments.</li></ul><p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Software maintenance mainly refers to the partial or complete modification of the application program according to changes in demand or changes in the hardware environment</span><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">.

To increase accuracy, t</span>he system updates information once a week in case there are changes in class time or course syllabus. Also, accounts will be closed and treated as garbage data if they are inactive for more than two years to reduce the system workload. </p><p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"><br/></p><p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"><br/></p><h2 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-Scalability">Scalability</h2><ul><li>As a user, I want the software to be smooth to use and to be able to store as much data as possible.</li><li>As a user, I want to trust this software and suggest this software to other students.</li></ul><p>The software has a better algorithm and has better extensibility.

These pages are: Profile, Schedule, Assignments, and To-Do. <br/>A prototype for the Profile page is shown in Figure 1. This page is where the user can customize their classes and activities. When the plus symbol beside Classes or Activities is clicked, it will open the window shown in the sketch. The user can then enter the class’s name and choose a colour to associate with it. When the user clicks on one of the classes or activities on the list, it will open a screen that can be used to edit the class’ name or colour, and will allow them to add or remove events to the schedule. The colour of each class is used on the other pages for its events, assignments, and tasks, to help the user easily identify the activity.<br/>The Schedule page will be used to provide an easy-to-understand schedule for users to refer to. The top right has a button that can be used to add events, as an alternative to adding events from the Profile page. There are a number of filters available, allowing the user to change the visibility of events based on their class or activity, and the event type. The user can also choose the information displayed, enabling or disabling the class, the even type, and the location. The schedule can be shown in a list view, or in a week view. The list view is sorted by event day and time and is shown in Figure 2. The second option is a timetable view, shown in Figure 3.<br/>The third page is the Assignments page. The add button at the top right can be used to create new assignments with their information.  The assignments shown can be filtered according to their class and their type. The first option to view the assignment is a list view, which can be sorted according to the class, due date, or the weight of how much the assignment is worth. This view is shown in Figure 4. The second option for viewing their assignments is a calendar view, which can be shown for the week, month, or term. To make the calendar easier to use, not all the information is shown in the video, but when an assignment is hovered over by the mouse, it will show the rest of the information. These different calendar views are shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7. <br/>The last page is the To-Do list, with tasks that can be filtered by activity and date to complete. The list can be sorted by category, name, or date. The user can click on the squares beside the task to toggle the checkmark on and off, indicating whether the task has been completed.</p><h1 id="RequirementsAnalysisDocument-SketchesofGUI">Sketches of
