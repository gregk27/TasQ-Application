The software will mostly focus on the needs of university students, but its features will also be useful for high school students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Users will be able to enter information into the system which will organize and display all data in an easy-to-track display. The software will have various features such as a schedule, reminder system, to-do list, sorting, and filters, profile feature, and a search function. Some of the functions listed are stretch goals and will be done only if the team deems it realistic. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The schedule feature will provide users with both a list view or calendar view of their weekly class schedule, and will also allow them to add other events.</span><br style="text-align: left;"/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Users can add their upcoming assignments and tests which can be sorted or filtered according to the name, class, the due date, or weighting. All events entered in the calendar will have a &quot;reminder&quot; function where users can choose if and when they want to be reminded about that event. Users will be able to search by event or class name to display all relevant information or events. </span><br style="text-align: left;"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Users will be able to create To-Do Lists. These lists are separate from the events in the calendar and are intended for the users to jot down short-term tasks that are easily accessible. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Each user will have a profile where they will be able to insert their name, age, school, and profile picture. This feature will be on the team's &quot;stretch goal&quot; list as it will require a more in-depth backend process. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The software will integrate a tab design to allow users to easily switch between the class schedule, assignment pages, and to-do lists.</span></p>
